Cloud computing is defined as the practice of using a network of remote servers hosted on the internet in order to store, process and manage.

ON-PREMISE VS CLOUD COMPUTING

1. On-premise infrastructure involves hosting all IT resources locally on your organization's hardware, allowing full control but requiring more hands-on maintenance. Cloud computing relies on third-party hosting of resources accessed remotely via the internet.

2. On-premise has higher initial setup costs but more security and independence, while cloud computing has lower costs and instant scalability but dependence on an external provider.

3. Security and regulatory compliance favors on-premise, while flexibility, scalability and cost favor cloud computing

ADVANTAGES OF ON-PREMISES ENVIRONMENT 

1. Greater Security: The systems and data are entirely in your control, you avoid exposing confidential information to outside cloud providers.

2. Easier compliance with regulations: Rather than trusting that a cloud vendor appropriately secures data according to your industry's rules, on-premise environments allow direct verification that all controls and policies are followed.

3. Independence from internet issues: Downtime risks from internet failures or regional outages do not impact your ability to use business-critical systems and information
